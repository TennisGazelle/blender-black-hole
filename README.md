# blender-black-hole
An extension of a black-hole effect simulation with procedural, emissive clouds. CCs welcome.

## recognition
The Black Hole Material in the relevant `.blend` files is from a file I got from blendswap, and I promise I'm trying my best to find the source URL and I will update this as soon as I can.
If you know who it might be, hmu.
If this *is* you, most def hmu, collab?

It's basically a mesh based hack to pretend to curve light.
Think how dominoes would be arranged if you were making a half turn about 6 inches wide except it went down the surface of the sphere.
So it's basically more of an acorn shape.
And its glass with a variable IOR along the inner axis.

## original work
Simple procedural clouds texture with emissive properties and volumetric absorption.
